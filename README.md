# An ARM Assembler written in Lisp
This is an ARM Thumb assembler written in Lisp.

The version **ARM Assembler.lisp** will run under my uLisp interpreter for microcontroller boards, to allow you to generate machine-code functions that can be run from Lisp.
For more information see http://www.ulisp.com/show?2YRU.

The version **ARM Assembler CL.lisp** can be run under Common Lisp and includes a **defcode** macro to assemble ARM functions and print the resulting machine code.

For information about how the assembler works see: http://www.ulisp.com/show?4HP3.

For a list of the ARM Thumb instructions supported by the assembler see: http://www.ulisp.com/show?30B8.
